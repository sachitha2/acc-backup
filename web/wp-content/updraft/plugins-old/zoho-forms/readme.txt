**Configuring your WordPress form**

Here's a step-by-step guide that will help you to configure Zoho Forms for Wordpress.

1. Login to your Zoho Forms account and create a form according to your needs. If you have not created an account in Zoho Forms yet, sign up now in just a few clicks. 
2. Click the Embed icon on your WordPress builder and choose the Zoho Forms block. Select your Zoho account's domain. You will be prompted to sign in to your Zoho Forms account (if you have not signed in already). 
3. You can click **Access Zoho Forms** and pick a form that you have already created or click **Embed using permalink** to enter the form's permalink without signing in.
4. Once you choose your form, you will find two options to embed your form. You can either choose to embed your form using an iFrame code or a JavaScript code. 
5. If you select the iFrame option, you can define the form container's width and the height according to your wish. 
6. If you choose the JavaScript option, you will have the option to set the form container's width, and the height will adjust automatically depending on the number of fields in your form. 
7. In the end, you can also add parameters to your form's URL to track form submissions or prefill form fields. [Click here](https://www.zoho.com/forms/help/settings/field-alias.html) to learn more about the URL parameters in Zoho Forms.

**Embed using Short Code**

Shortcodes in WordPress are code shortcuts that help you add dynamic content. They are displayed inside square brackets. You can embed a Zoho Form on your website by creating a short code in the format shown below:

**[zohoForms src=<Form Permalink URL> width=100% height=600px urlparams="<parameter name>" type=<js/iframe> autoheight=<true/false>]**


*Note: You can copy the Form Permalink from the [Share](https://www.zoho.com/forms/help/share/public-sharing.html) tab in your form builder.*

These setup instructions are for WordPress versions 5.0 and above.
